Incident Reporting and Response System
Overview
The Incident Reporting and Response System is a web application designed to help organizations report, track, and manage incidents in real time. The system allows users to submit incident reports, view active incidents, and monitor response actions, with real-time updates for high-priority situations. This project demonstrates full stack development skills and incorporates critical features such as secure user authentication, role-based access control, data visualization, and audit logging.

Features
Incident Submission: Users can report incidents, including details such as description, location, severity, and priority.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Role-based permissions allow admins to manage incidents, while responders can view and update incidents assigned to them.
Real-Time Updates: Incident statuses are updated in real time to provide immediate feedback for high-severity incidents.
Data Visualization Dashboard: A dashboard displays key metrics and visualizations, including incident trends, status distribution, and response times.
Audit Log: All changes to incidents are logged for audit purposes, including timestamps and user information.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MySQL
Real-Time Updates: WebSockets (or Firebase, if applicable)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Visualization Library: Chart.js or D3.js
